/**
 `LCLiquidView` exposes an `LCMicroService` through a UI.  An `LCMicroService` attaches to a UI
 in JavaScript by calling `LiquidCore.attach(surface, callback)` where
 `surface` is a string representing the `LCSurface` class canonical name
 (e.g. `org.liquidplayer.surfaces.console.ConsoleSurface`) and `callback` is a
 callback function which accepts an `error` parameter.  If `error` is `undefined`, then the
 `LCSurface` was attached correctly and is ready for use.  Otherwise, `error` is a descriptive
 error message.
